government is not a monolithic thing which is your enemy it's a multitudinous thing which is your enemy

our dream was to enable the future of human freedom in the early 1990s a group
0:13
of mathematicians misfits hackers and hobbyists came together around a shared belief that the internet would either
0:18
demolish artificial walls or lay the groundwork for an orwellian state we can
0:23
prevent the ministry of truth they saw a branch of mathematics called
0:28
cryptography as a weapon against central planning and surveillance in this new virtual world and what is a cypher
0:35
cyberpunks are cryptography activists the more i realized how it was a really pivotal technology for society
0:42
the national security agency declared the unrestrained public discussion of cryptographic research threatened our
0:48
national security i saw this as the critical fork in the road for the future
0:53
of human freedom coming up reason presents a four-part series and a movement that foresaw both the promise
0:59
and the peril that lay ahead when the internet upended the world it's like standing on top of the mountain and seeing that this is out there you people
1:06
who are here can say okay what kind of world do we really want to build and build it
1:12
[Music]
1:22
imagine if you will sitting down to your morning coffee turning on your home computer to read the day's newspaper
1:27
well it's not as far-fetched as it may seem the freedom issues were very important to us this is an example of what you can
1:35
order through your computer it combines the power of your computer with the convenience of your telephone
1:41
we saw that information technology could create a 1984 style tyrannical top-down
1:48
control society or it could develop into something that is a decentralized
1:54
enabler of human freedom and even back then our dream was to
2:00
enable the future of human freedom in the late 1980s at the dawn of the online age a group of young computer
2:06
scientists in silicon valley started grappling with what this new technology would mean for society we took a look at
2:13
the potential of computer systems and saw that for everything about civilization that enables it to work we
2:20
can enable it to work much better the most influential figure in what would become the cypherpunk movement was the
2:27
physicist tim may who envisioned the future internet as a place for what he would dub crypto anarchy where
2:33
lawbreakers radicals and political dissidents could shield their activities from government surveillance and control
2:39
people doing things that didn't require permissions from anyone because the people were untraceable it couldn't be stopped but there was another group that
2:45
saw the potential of computers to remake society gradually from within by decentralizing commerce and improving
2:51
the dissemination of knowledge they were dubbed the high-tech hiaquids because their worldview was influenced by the
2:57
work of austrian economist friedrich hayek the fundamental insights of hayeking economics was how separately
3:04
formulated plans tend to mesh well and we saw electronic media as a
3:11
enabler of coordination the complexity that the world previously was really not
3:16
capable of the clash of visions between the high-tech hayekians who wanted to build a borderless frictionless global
3:23
marketplace and the crypto anarchists who saw the internet as a technological means of undermining all governments set
3:29
the course for the cypherpunk movement if may was the father of cryptoanarchy
3:35
the central figure for the high-tech hayekians was the economist and entrepreneur phil salen now if you own a
3:41
personal computer we are told you can shop at home in what's called the electronic mall it was a few years
3:47
before the invention of the world wide web but computer companies were offering a new type of service in which customers
3:52
could connect through their phone lines to post messages to a bulletin board check their horoscopes or go shopping
3:58
you can buy items from department stores ranging from nordstrom's to neiman marcus all via computer screen
4:05
salen whose outlook was shaped by his careful reading of hayek understood that these services weren't merely a
4:10
curiosity or a digital version of the old mail order catalog they were the beginning of something that had the
4:15
potential to one day erase national boundaries through trade and undermine government power
4:21
in a prescient 1991 essay he foresaw how the internet would change the world by
4:26
1995 2000 and beyond the static role of store and shopper seller and buyer
4:33
author and reader systems defined by their one-way information flows will be replaced by new forms of media enabling
4:41
two-way information flows before getting involved with computers salen had run a private rocket company
4:47
and had co-authored a congressional study critical of nasa's wasteful spending but in his view there was
4:52
continuity between his interests in space travel and computing because in both industries technology's purpose was
4:58
to drive down the transaction costs that impede human activity making it feasible to explore new frontiers and interact in
5:05
ways that would otherwise be prohibitively expensive now thanks to breakthroughs in computing
5:10
the ability to buy or obtain exactly the information you need when you want it in the form you want it is about to explode
5:17
at a speed unmatched since the invention of printing but salen was foremost an entrepreneur
5:24
and in the mid-1980s he set out to launch one of those platforms for buying and selling information
5:30
he called it the american information exchange or amex this business that we're doing is to make possible a new
5:37
kind of thing which is being able to buy and sell information online amex was a radical idea in the
5:44
mid 1980s users could buy or sell advice about the real estate market writing
5:49
software or what companies to invest in now you can say to somebody so it's like
5:54
ebay or like priceline or like amazon when we tried to explain this to people they simply couldn't get it they could
6:01
not wrap their heads around this some of them i think couldn't imagine the
6:06
computational end of it milton friedman didn't get it though it was similar in ways to the online marketplaces that
6:11
would launch a decade later amex was more than just an idea before its time
6:17
what set it apart was its grounding in political philosophy and its lofty goal of elevating individual decision making
6:23
over central planning it was an instantiation of austrian economics
6:29
now put into code and put online something like this could have profound
6:34
human consequences and that was the vision a fluid transaction-oriented market
6:40
system with two-way feedback salen wrote would result in crowding out monolithic mostly government bureaucracies
6:47
we were laying the philosophical foundations of what is e-commerce that
6:52
you can now have creative explosion it's going to change the world yes that's
6:58
right intermediating among large populations
7:03
of human beings through electronic means results in all kinds of fascinating emergent social behavior amex's chief
7:10
architect was the pioneering software engineer chip morningstar who had come from a stint at george lucas's
7:15
production studio where he oversaw the creation of habitat which was one of the first online virtual communities after
7:22
joining amex morningstar co-authored an essay which argued that in building a world in software detailed central
7:28
planning is impossible the world is just more complicated people are more complicated you cannot know what all
7:34
their goals are what you can do is you can put them into an environment in which certain kinds of things are
7:39
possible what you can't do is tell people what they want
7:45
phil sale and mark miller and chip morningstar's ideas about how a future internet could decentralize society
7:51
inspired tim may to first articulate a radically different vision may who would go on to become the most influential
7:57
figure in the cypherpunk movement was introduced to salem by morningstar in december of 1987. chip said there's this
8:04
guy out in santa cruz that you ought to talk to as a scientist at intel may had solved an issue affecting the reliability of
8:11
the company's memory chips called the alpha particle problem rich on stock options he'd been spending his days at
8:18
the beach reading science fiction novels thinking about how networked personal computers could turn some of their
8:24
futuristic scenarios into reality so i met with phil in redwood city and he
8:29
described how amex would work and i said people aren't going to be selling meaningless stuff like surfboard
8:36
recommendations in may's view amex could be useful as a tool for undermining state power but only by shattering legal
8:43
and social norms i said it's going to be corporate information it's going to be bomber plans for the b1 bomber who wants
8:49
to buy that a competitor a company who wants to sell that someone who has access to that information it's two
8:55
different types of libertarians he didn't understand the extent to which you could benefit the world by lowering
9:01
transaction costs for everybody
9:14
like salem in the high-tech kayakians may saw the personal computer as enabling technology for sweeping
9:20
societal changes but he had a different vision of a virtual marketplace for any and all goods and services which he
9:26
dubbed blacknet or a technological means of undermining all governments on amex user activity was out in the
9:34
open but black net would be impervious to government tracking and surveillance and perhaps it would be a network with
9:40
no owners at all many people's first response would be to say that black net won't be allowed to
9:45
happen perhaps but technology would probably make it inevitable if you don't physically meet the person
9:51
if you don't even know what continent they're on you can't coerce them tim may's a smart guy he you know he was
9:57
great for honing our ideas and technologies against but you know i think him as sort
10:03
of the shock jock for uh cypherpunks i want to live in the world that
10:08
surrounds us rather than try and construct one from scratch we saw this as emerging from inside the
10:16
world and carrying the world along with it in 1988 amex was acquired by the
10:23
software giant autodesk a growing scene of young technologists came together around salem and the high-tech kayakians
10:30
all working towards a common vision of enhancing human freedom through networked personal computing it was this
10:36
hot house of ideas from which a world view was brewing
10:43
salem died of cancer in 1991 the same year that the world wide web became publicly available but his intellectual
10:50
contributions and conflict with may had laid the groundwork for what would come next for the cypherpunks the long effort
10:56
to build a self-sovereign and anonymous form of digital money and the embrace of a branch of mathematics called
11:02
cryptography which they came to view as the key to personal liberation on the internet
11:10
[Music]
11:18
the title of the book is the rise of the computer state what i'm saying is that large bureaucracies with the power that
11:26
the computer gives them become more powerful and that they are escaping the checks and balances of representative
11:33
democracy in 1983 the new york times reporter david burnham warned that the
11:38
integration of computers into every aspect of daily life could lead to a level of automated surveillance unknown
11:45
in any previous age for society to change course burnham argued citizens would need to rise up through the
11:51
democratic process and demand new legal protections to safeguard their privacy there are ways to deal with it we have
11:58
done it and all i hope is that we're on our toes enough and alert enough to
12:04
see them and go after them this is just political jaw boning a few years later a physicist named tim may argued that
12:11
putting faith in representative democracy was naive he believed that only innovation could save us from the
12:17
orwellian state the interesting things that had happened had been technological changes the telephone copy machine the
12:24
vcr computers may became a co-founder of the cypherpunk movement which came together
12:30
around the idea that a recent breakthrough in the field of cryptography was the key innovation for combating tyranny comparable to how the
12:38
crossbow enabled individuals to go up against medieval armies it's an epiphany it's like standing on top of the
12:43
mountain and seeing that this is out there coming up reason takes a look at how one community came to see cryptography as a
12:50
powerful weapon for defeating big brother here's part two in a four part series on how the cypherpunk movement
12:56
anticipated the promise and the peril that lay ahead when the internet upended the world
13:01
[Music]
13:15
in the late 1970s there was an astonishing breakthrough in the field of cryptography
13:20
i saw this as the critical fork in the road for the future of human freedom i
13:25
really did in the summer of 77 mark miller was a 20
13:31
year old student at yale working for a counter-cultural tech visionary named ted nelson like many future cypherpunks
13:37
he would learn of this groundbreaking discovery when the august issue of scientific american arrived at his door
13:44
and i'm reading [Music] i'm reading martin gardner's
13:49
mathematical games column i just get incredibly excited just incredibly
13:55
excited i call up ted in the middle of the night and i tell ted we can prevent
14:01
the ministry of truth as gardner told his readers a discovery
14:06
had been made that would revolutionize the entire field of secret communication it was the work of teams of
14:12
mathematicians and computer scientists at mit and stanford including a young researcher named
14:18
whitfield diffie if you look at 1791 at the moment of the bill of rights
14:24
impenetrably private conversations dominated what the framers didn't
14:29
foresee is that private communication would happen via computers sending messages across the world that could
14:35
easily be intercepted public key cryptography gives you a mechanism whereby you can recover this ability to
14:42
have an impenetrably private conversation between two people look at this a cipher well let's go back
14:49
to the office and get started on it sending a secret message used to involve translating words through a secret code
14:55
that spies in government agents could potentially crack phil i think i've got it good
15:02
z is d v is e anyone sending and receiving
15:08
messages also had to have a copy of the secret key or translation device just like the decipher rings collected by
15:15
american school children starting in the 1930s here's how you can get one for your very own
15:21
first get a jar of chocolate flavored ovaltine public key cryptography made decoding devices unnecessary and
15:27
figuring out the pattern effectively impossible
15:32
the big breakthrough was an easy to solve mathematical formula that you could funnel words into just as easily
15:38
as dropping them through a trap door but if you flip the problem around and tried to pull the message out the other
15:44
side in that direction the formula was almost impossible to solve such that even a super computer trying random
15:51
numbers would need 40 quadrillion years to service the answer but the person who set up the mathematical formula or
15:58
trapdoor held the answer to the problem or secret code making it possible for that person to retrieve the original
16:04
message it could also be compared to the most ubiquitous trapdoor system for sending
16:10
messages consider a mailbox anyone can throw a letter in a mailbox but only the
16:15
mailman who has a key can take it out anyone in the world could set up one of
16:20
these equations serving as the mailman of his or her very own impenetrable virtual letterbox and because that
16:27
individual could prove ownership of the mailbox by opening it with the only known key public key cryptography also
16:34
made it possible to set up a provable identity on the internet completely disconnected from any real-world
16:40
personal information knowing economics what you do and looking at what's happening with the internet what do you
16:45
what can you see happening way out there in the future the most striking non-obvious thing is that current technologies are in the
16:52
process of giving us a level of privacy we have never had before essentially
16:58
there are now well-known ways available in free software of
17:04
encrypting messages so that only the intended recipient can read them so that if the fbi intercepts them it's
17:11
gibberish to them one way of reading the second amendment
17:16
is that it was a way of making sure that if the government tried to suppress the people the people would win and the
17:22
militia wouldn't be very good but it would outnumber the professionals
17:28
in the modern world the weapons that the army has differ by a lot more than they did in the 18th
17:34
century but i also think that if you look at what politics are like nowadays the real
17:40
wars between the government and the population are information wars not physical wars encryption means that they
17:46
can't arrest you they can't blackmail your your your key people can't do any of the
17:52
things governments might do to make sure that public information is what they wanted
17:59
meanwhile the u.s intelligence community was doing everything in its power to keep this new tool out of the hands of
18:05
the public well somebody once said to me if you think new directions had an impact on the outside world you should
18:11
have seen the impact it had at nsa in part three in this series we'll look at the u.s government's effort to halt
18:18
the widespread use of public key cryptography by threatening criminal prosecution
18:23
and the legal and public relations battle waged by one founding member of the cypherpunks for freedom of speech
18:30
and software [Music]
18:40
a hurricane of unrestrained joy sweeps through every part of a war sick world the breaking of encryption was essential
18:47
to the war effort [Music] england would probably have fallen if they'd not been able to read the enigma
18:54
messages because every time the germans sent bombers the raf knew where they
19:00
were sending them and could mass the planes there to defend if any significant fraction of those attacks
19:07
had gotten through england would have been much more helpless may well have fallen in the world course of world war
19:12
ii may have changed and that is the origin of the regulations that said this
19:19
is a munition this is an item of war and the problem was they didn't really take
19:25
freedom of speech freedom of inquiry academic freedom into account in that
19:32
but on the matter of encryption terrorists are going to have these are law enforcement
19:43
and get vital information i think that's the same choice coming up the story of the us government's long battle to keep
19:49
strong encryption out of the hands of its citizens and how first amendment activists fought back
19:55
here's part three in a four part series on how the cypherpunk movement of the 1990s anticipated the promise and the
20:01
peril that lay ahead when the internet upended the world
20:09
[Music] in 1977 researchers at mit made an
20:15
astonishing discovery a mathematical system for encrypting secret messages so
20:20
powerful that it had the potential to make government spying effectively impossible
20:25
but before these mathematicians could publish their research the nsa made it clear that doing so could land them in
20:31
federal prison the u.s government considered these mathematical systems modern weapons
20:37
technologies and distributing them was a crime under the international traffic and arms regulations mit halted plans to
20:44
distribute the paper i decided quite literally they are going to classify this over my
20:51
dead body mark miller was a 20 year old student at yale who had read about this discovery in scientific american so i traveled to
20:59
mit managed to get my hand on a paper copy of this thing i went to a variety
21:05
of different copy shops so i wasn't making lots of copies in any one place i
21:10
sent them to home and hobbyist computer organizations and magazines all across the country and i gave copies of the
21:18
paper to some select friends of mine and i told them if i disappear
21:25
make sure this gets out early in 1978 the u.s federal government
21:33
backed off and decided to allow the publication and the world has been on a different course ever since it got
21:39
published but the crypto wars were just getting started in the late 70s the national
21:45
security agency declared the unrestrained public discussion of cryptographic research threatened our
21:50
national security the private cryptography community and the government have been sparring over the issue ever since
21:58
marshall mcluhan said that one day we would all live in a global village well the global village has arrived and its
22:05
main street is called the internet the internet also created an electronic surveillance apparatus there was like
22:12
nothing the world had ever seen which meant that the cryptography breakthroughs of the 1970s were no
22:17
longer a rarified topic they were privacy salvation internet users could
22:22
shield their online activities from spying and that sent the intelligence community once again scrambling to stop
22:28
the dissemination of this powerful tool in 1991 a software developer named phil
22:33
zimmerman released the first relatively easy to use secret messaging system built with strong encryption which was
22:40
called pgp somehow it got overseas now that it's over there people are using it and i'm
22:45
delighted to hear good stories about how it's used in places where there are oppressive governments so the
22:51
u.s justice department launched a three-year criminal investigation of zimmerman on the grounds that by making
22:57
his software accessible outside the country he could be guilty of exporting weapons under the arms control act
23:04
meanwhile the national security agency argued that zimmerman's software would be used by child molesters and criminals
23:10
pgp they say is out there to protect freedom fighters in latvia said the nsa's general counsel but the fact is
23:16
the only use that has come to the attention of law enforcement agencies is a guy who is using pgp so the police
23:22
could not tell what little boys he had seduced over the net child pornographers terrorists money wanderers take your
23:28
pick these are the people who will be invoked as the bringers of death and destruction well it's true it's true
23:36
it's true so they're right yes but all technologies have had bad
23:42
effects the telephones allow extortion death threats bomb threats kidnapping cases
23:48
uncontrolled publishing of books could allow satanic books to appear the cypherpunks argued that pgp was like
23:54
any other published material because under the hood it was just a series of instructions to be carried out by a
24:00
machine restraint on freedom of expression of software writers is anathema in a free society and a
24:05
violation of the first amendment wrote the economist and entrepreneur phil salen in a 1991 essay titled freedom of
24:12
speech and software encryption can't be controlled whether or not it's powerful or has impacts on
24:19
the government because it's free speech in the early 90s john gilmore who was a co-founder of the cypherpunk movement
24:26
risked going to jail in his campaign to force the government to acknowledge that regulating encryption violated the first
24:32
amendment we basically had a community of a thousand people scattered around who were all trying different ideas on
24:39
how to get around the government to get encryption to the masses what we're afraid of several years from
24:46
now is the terrorists both hit their encryption button on the telephone and even though we have access we can't
24:51
understand what they're saying on a real-time basis the clinton administration told congress that americans have no constitutional right
24:58
to choose their own method of encryption and push for legislation that would require companies to build in a
25:03
mechanism for law enforcement agencies to break in we're in favor of strong encryption robust encryption we just
25:09
want to make sure we have a trap door and a key under some judge's authority where we can get there if
25:16
if somebody is planning a crime the cypherpunks look for ways to undercut the government's case by pointing out
25:21
the similarities between encryption software and other forms of protected speech with phil zimmerman under federal
25:28
investigation for making his software available for download outside the us to prove a point he convinced mit press to
25:35
mirror his action in the analog world by printing out the pgp source code adding a binding and shipping it to european
25:42
bookstores the government knew if they went to court to suppress the publication of a book from a university
25:48
that they would lose and they would lose in a hurry there were people who actually got encryption
25:54
code tattooed on their bodies and then started asking can i go to a foreign
25:59
country we printed up t-shirts that had encryption code on them and submitted
26:05
them to the government office of munitions control can we publish this t-shirt
26:11
ultimately they never answered that query because they realized to say no would be to invite a lawsuit they would
26:18
lose and so the best answer was no answer at all talk a little bit more about encryption technology no no
26:28
thank you i i hesitate even to make use the word but i'm not using it any more way
26:34
in 1996 the justice department announced that it wouldn't pursue criminal charges against phil zimmerman and major court
26:40
victories came when two federal judges found that encryption is protected by the first amendment the crypto wars are
26:46
still ongoing what we won in the first round was the right to publish it and
26:52
the right to put it in mass-market software but what we didn't actually do is deploy it in mass-market software
26:59
now there are major companies building serious encryption into their products
27:05
and we're getting a lot of pushback from the government about this we're about the rule of law but we don't want to create spaces that are beyond the reach
27:11
of the law in the united states right it's not just the reprehensible behavior of sexual predation on children but
27:18
myriad additional forms of serious crime enabled by end-to-end
27:24
encryption i'm not optimistic that privacy will prevail in the crypto wars
27:30
it's an ongoing struggle in the early 90s at the same time that gilmore was fighting his legal battle
27:37
for freedom of speech and software the cypherpunks were exploring cryptography's potential in the context
27:42
of collapsing political borders and the rise of liberal democracy part four in this series will look at how those
27:48
dreams turn to disillusionment the death of the cypherpunk movement and its rebirth following the invention of
27:54
bitcoin
27:59
you're looking at this and going wow wouldn't it be amazing if this worked and then you realized oh my gosh it does work national borders are just speed
28:06
bumps in the information super high cryptography is really really strong we
28:11
can do whatever we want people might provide the equivalent of what government does in a decentralized
28:16
fashion i talk about collapse of governments i think we actually saw that in the middle ages probably as a result
28:22
of the printing press this is the story of a community of
28:27
scientists mathematicians philosophers and activists who believe that the internet combined with recent
28:32
breakthroughs in the field of cryptography would upend society and usher in a new era of sovereign
28:38
individualism we have it in our power to begin the world over again right now and it's
28:44
internal clash over the optimal path to achieving that goal can evil be done with this technology yes
28:52
and so what so then deal with it here's the final installment in a four-part series on the origins of the
28:59
cypherpunk movement and how it helped shape our modern world [Music]
29:15
[Music] we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity unprecedented in all
29:23
human history mr gorbachev tear down this wall
29:31
if you had asked me 10 years ago is it possible that communism could collapse by the year 1992 that i would have said
29:38
absolutely ridiculous the fall of the berlin wall was important to me because i thought it was
29:44
the end of history and that national borders would cease being the walls of
29:49
prisons and so a couple years later when i discovered the internet i thought oh this is part of this pattern where
29:57
borders and distance stop being barriers to people
30:02
then i discovered a whole clan of people who self-identified as
30:07
computer people found my tribe and among that clan was
30:13
the cypherpunk's mailing list if you want to subscribe to our mailing list send a blank email message and just
30:19
say subscribe cyberpunks and what is a cypherpunk what do you guys stand for cyberpunks are cryptography activists
30:24
the cypherpunk's email list which started in the fall of 1992 one year after the launch of the world wide web
30:31
became a gathering place for a global community interested in using cryptography to allow individuals to
30:37
communicate and transact on the internet privately and without interference from a central authority in the last 20 years
30:43
the basic techniques to do all sorts of impossible seeming things
30:49
have suddenly emerged put them into practice many cypherpunks were inspired by the work of the computer scientist
30:55
david chong who demonstrated that it was possible to use cryptography to build an anonymous payment network that ran on
31:02
the internet because of the cypherpunks and because of the science papers of david chom i thought the third thing is
31:09
going to happen is economic freedom that people are going to be no longer constrained by national borders and
31:16
distance from cooperating and sharing resources and
31:21
helping each other but at this watershed moment of collapsing borders there was a divide within the cypherpunk community
31:27
over whether these cryptographic tools would lead to more individual freedom free trade in the spread of democracy or
31:33
the end of government altogether the cypherpunk movement's most influential figure was the physicist and
31:39
intellectual provocateur tim may who coined the phrase cryptoanarchy he saw the fall of the berlin wall as evidence
31:46
that the societal institutions we take for granted could collapse in short order just as they had in the middle
31:51
ages we saw the little principalities the monarchies the religious the papal states we saw those collapse probably as
31:58
a result of publishing printing may penned a one-page summary of how cryptography would upend society so i
32:05
just sat down at my little macintosh and loosely patterned this after the communist manifesto the spectre is
32:12
haunting the modern world the specter of crypto anarchy cryptography is really really strong
32:19
we can be protected from anything without from the observers from the watchers from the
32:26
imposers of the past upon the future we're trying to create
32:32
may was skeptical of the idea that humanity was witnessing an unabashed victory of economic and political
32:38
liberalism or that it was possible to overcome tyranny through collective action as the political scientist
32:44
francis fukuyama argued we as human beings want to be recognized with a certain dignity this is the essential
32:50
driving force behind democratic revolutions whether they take place in eastern europe or in asia or in latin
32:56
america may embraced a technology-based theory of historic change summed up by the movement's tagline which was coined
33:03
by the mathematician eric hughes cypherpunk's write code what eric meant by cypherpunk's right code is don't be
33:10
one of those guys who goes to a libertarian party conference and sits about getting somebody elected to the los gatos city council
33:17
that way lies madness whereas the interesting things that had happened had been technological changes
33:24
the telephone the copy machine the vcr the philosophy that i really got
33:29
interested in is that you don't just go and ask the regulator oh we need more privacy online we go fix it arguing and
33:35
complaining and lobbying and politics have nominal effect on what changes the world is technology adoption
33:42
and you know society moving shifting spew points for crypto anarchists like may writing
33:49
code meant building systems for anonymous transactions on the internet that made the arbitrary divisions of the
33:55
political world irrelevant national borders are just speed bumps on the information super highway
34:00
online cryptographic networks would be structured like a geodesic dome a form hailed by the countercultural
34:06
technologists of the 1970s for being in harmony with nature and highly resistant to external attack networks with no
34:13
owners with many interconnecting nodes that would be basically unstoppable in a geodesic market economics will no
34:20
longer be the handmaiden of politics the cypherpunk writer robert hettinger noted and nation-states will eventually be as
34:26
ceremonial as modern-day constitutional monarchs this idea of a many to many connection was clearly going to happen
34:35
but it was much easier to build a functional network for cooperation and trade when you can rely on a central
34:40
authority to enforce the rules how can we use this weird crypto technique to solve
34:47
this strange esoteric little problem that in the real world you just solve because oh i know what your social security
34:53
number is or you have to have your you know government issued id that you know you take into the bank so you can open
34:59
up your bank account and they can link the two together and say okay if jim mccoy walks out on this hundred thousand
35:05
dollar loan well we know where to find them i was trying to deal with those problems you can buy and sell property in cyberspace using cryptographic
35:11
protocols the idea of ways in which people might provide the equivalent of what government does in a decentralized
35:18
fashion tim stole some ideas from my machinery of freedom and he reprocessed them with all this technology and then i
35:24
stole them back a function of government that was particularly hard to replicate using cryptography was the issuance of
35:30
money the cypherpunks attempted to build a borderless internet currency system as anonymous as cash and that like gold
35:37
held its value without the backing of a central bank gold makes very good money because nobody can manufacture more of
35:44
it very readily pretty mildly right whereas bits are perfectly copyable so
35:50
turning bits into good money is quite difficult tim me and many others considered electronic cash to be the
35:56
holy grail because it completed the picture a private and decentralized monetary system may argued was a key
36:03
component in constructing a new borderless world where the activities and assets of individuals would be
36:09
resistant to government control and confiscation you don't physically meet the person if you don't even know what continent
36:15
they're on you can't coerce them [Music] but there was another faction within the
36:21
movement that rejected tim may's vision of cordoning off a new world in cyberspace
36:26
the high-tech kayakings were people like eric drexler mark miller phil salem
36:32
they were focused on designing secure computing systems based on economic insights particularly those of the
36:38
austrian-born nobel prize winner friedrich hayek instead of building a new virtual world shielded from
36:43
government interference the high-tech hayekians sought to use technology to demolish walls and divisions within the
36:50
existing world they imagined that introducing new tools for human coordination would gradually
36:56
erode the government's ability to impinge on our freedoms we did lots and lots of fantasizing about how the world
37:04
could be different but we saw this as emerging from inside the world
37:10
cryptography was a tool for porting economic concepts and legal structures onto the internet but the aim was to
37:16
foster new forms of peer-to-peer commerce and knowledge sharing and the high-tech kayakings believe that even
37:22
imperfect systems can transform society gradually from within the overall arc of world history is
37:30
towards rule of law towards less corruptible systems if the emergence of the world of crypto
37:36
commerce creates systems that are vastly less corruptible
37:42
but under a whole mix of different mechanisms and governance regimes
37:50
such that they're not always everywhere uncorruptable
37:58
i think that's fine there's a lot of power in providing people tools such that they can
38:05
successfully start to act more like you would like them to as opposed to you've got to come over here where it's really
38:11
hard edge encrypted and it works exactly the way we want no no you know let's let's you know raise people's levels
38:16
incrementally and and that's an improvement in the world for many cypherpunks the darker side of
38:23
cryptoanarchy was epitomized by the writings of the chemist and electrical engineer jim bell a participant on the
38:29
email list who in the mid compared aggression by the state to that of muggers rapists robbers and murderers
38:36
and posited a cryptographically protected marketplace in which anonymous individuals could in effect pay to have
38:42
government employees killed with the goal of destroying the state in 1997 bell was arrested and went to
38:49
prison for among other things dropping a stink bomb on a government building tim may distanced himself from bell's
38:55
writings and activities while maintaining that marketplaces for assassination like the one bell had
39:01
described might be both inevitable and desirable can evil be done with
39:07
this technology not just the internet but especially the crypto part of it yes
39:14
and so what so then deal with it and zimmerman once told me
39:22
that he sometimes regretted ever introducing pgp to the world because it could be used by al qaeda or the taliban
39:29
or whatnot i say so what
39:37
i'm not morally responsible would have happened whether we had existed or not
39:44
because technology has its own logic and people want to do what they want to do i mean
39:50
they want free [ __ ] they want freedom to do things even if they say this should be regulated
39:56
they'll often make the conscious decision to copy music copy videotapes they want to see
40:02
black net is a negative consequence i'm not interested in creating that when you build technology to solve
40:08
problems then you create then there are there are consequences that we try to think ahead of and look at and figure
40:15
out how we might address and get ahead of the the downsides of what we build and that's responsible development and
40:22
we certainly engaged in that and and and and talking with tim may and and putting on that you know what if i was a
40:29
black cat kind of thing was certainly a useful foil for working through those kinds of ideas
40:35
but that's absolutely not what cypherpunks were so the progress of the spread of
40:41
democracy you know if you take a sufficiently long-term view of it has been really quite remarkable
40:54
our dream was to enable the future of human freedom and we had this bizarre
41:00
confidence about how the future would unfold and to you know using alan cave's
41:05
famous phrase to have a huge hand in inventing it
41:12
but the road had a lot more weeds and detours than we could have anticipated when we first launched we
41:19
were hoping for you know maybe 400 500 people now we're at 100 000 people so who knows where we're going using the
41:25
ever-growing storage capacity of servers belonging to companies like google instead of it being on your server under
41:32
your desk that stuff is being taken care of for you professionals keep track of all the programs and who doesn't want a
41:39
simpler life i find this way of working half a gigabyte of information on your
41:45
customers what do you do with that they want to know everything about you so they can sell you stuff and it results
41:51
in you each getting a digital proctology exam tnsa specifically targets the communications of everyone
41:58
over the next quarter century the internet would make possible an explosion of individual freedom and
42:03
information sharing just as phil salen had predicted in 1991 but it would also grow into a surveillance apparatus that
42:10
bore out the dystopian vision of journalist david burnham in his 1983 book the rise of the computer state
42:17
large bureaucracies with the power that the computer gives them become more
42:22
powerful and they are escaping the checks and balances of representative democracy
42:29
facebook collects information that the east german stasi would have killed for i think that most people are quite happy
42:35
to hand people all of the information about them online in return for a few pics of your high school friends
42:41
kids or whatever by the mid-2000s it seemed the cypherpunk movement had mostly failed then came a global
42:48
financial crisis followed by massive bailouts by central banks on october 31st 2008 a pseudonymous
42:55
inventor named satoshi nakamoto shared a white paper describing a new peer-to-peer non-governmental monetary
43:01
system pulling together technical and philosophical concepts developed on the cypherpunk's email list within a few
43:08
years the movement was reborn with a new generation committed to enhancing personal freedom and privacy with
43:14
cryptographic tools it's like discovering an oasis when you're lost in the desert it's bitcoin
43:20
that's single-handedly responsible for the current wave of cypherpunk
43:25
activity it's always messier than visionaries can anticipate because reality is bigger
43:32
than anyone head we're still on the road in the quest to build architectures that amplify human
43:40
freedoms and protect us from the dynamics in the other direction
