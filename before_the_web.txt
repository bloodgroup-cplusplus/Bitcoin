Hayekians = Phil Salen 

Computer companies were offering different types of services 

Salen was shaped by reading of hayekian economics 


In 
Government is not a monolithic  thing, which is your enemy.
0:02
It's a multitudinous thing, which is your enemy.
0:07
Our dream was to enable the  future of human freedom.
0:11
In the early 1990s, a group of mathematicians, misfits, hackers, and hobbyists
0:16
came together around a shared belief that the internet would either demolish artificial walls
0:20
or lay the groundwork for an Orwellian state.
0:23
We can prevent the Ministry of Truth.
0:27
They saw a branch of mathematics called cryptography
0:30
as a weapon against central planning and surveillance in this new virtual world.
0:34
And what is a cypherpunk? Cypherpunks are cryptography activists.
0:37
The more I realize how it was a  really pivotal technology for society.
0:42
The National Security Agency  declared the unrestrained public discussion
0:46
of cryptographic research  threatened our national security.
0:50
I saw this as the critical fork in the  road for the future of human freedom.
0:55
Coming up, Reason presents a four-part  series on a movement that foresaw both
0:58
the promise and the peril that lay ahead  when the internet upended the world.
1:02
It's like standing on top of the mountain  and seeing that this is out there.
1:06
You people who are here can say, "Okay, what kind of world do we really want to build?" And build it.
1:22
Imagine, if you will, sitting down to your morning coffee, turning on your home computer to read the day's newspaper.
1:27
Well, it's not as far-fetched as it may seem.
1:30
The freedom issues were very important to us.
1:33
This is a sample of what you  can order through your computer.
1:37
It combines the power of your computer  with the convenience of your telephone.
1:41
We saw that information technology could create  a 1984 style tyrannical top-down control society.
1:50
Or it could develop into something that is  a decentralized enabler of human freedom.
1:57
And even back then, our dream was to  enable the future of human freedom.
2:02
In the late 1980s at the dawn of the online  age, a group of young computer scientists in Silicon Valley
2:08
started grappling with what  this new technology would mean for society.
2:12
We took a look at the potential of computer  systems and saw that for everything about civilization
2:19
that enables it to work,  we can enable it to work much better.
2:23
The most influential figure in what  would become the cypherpunk movement
2:27
was the physicist, Tim May, who envisioned the  future internet as a place for what he would dub
2:31
"crypto-anarchy," where lawbreakers,  radicals, and political dissidents
2:35
could shield their activities from  government surveillance and control.
2:39
People doing things that  didn't require permissions
2:41
from anyone because the people were  untraceable, it couldn't be stopped.
2:44
But there was another group that saw the  potential of computers to remake society
2:48
gradually from within, by decentralizing commerce  and improving the dissemination of knowledge.
2:53
They were dubbed the High-Tech Hayekians  because their worldview was influenced by
2:57
the work of Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek.
3:00
The fundamental insights of Hayekian economics was
3:03
how separately formulated plans tend to  mesh well.
3:07
And we saw electronic media as a enabler of coordination of a complexity that the world previously was really not capable of.
3:18
The clash of visions between the High-Tech Hayekians,
3:21
who wanted to build a borderless, frictionless, global marketplace,
3:24
and the crypto-anarchist who saw the internet as a technological means of undermining all governments,
3:29
set the course for the cypherpunk movement.
3:33
If May was the father of crypto-anarchy,
3:35
the central figure for The High-Tech Hayekians  was the economist and entrepreneur, Phil Salin.
3:41
Now, if you own a personal computer,
3:42
we are told you can shop at home on  what's called The Electronic Mall.
3:46
It was a few years before the invention of the World  Wide Web but computer companies were offering
3:50
a new type of service in which customers  could connect through their phone lines
3:54
to post messages to a bulletin board,  check their horoscopes, or go shopping.
3:58
You can buy items from department stores
4:00
ranging from Nordstroms to Neiman  Marcus, all via computer screen.
4:05
Salin, whose outlook was shaped  by his careful reading of Hayek,
4:08
understood that these services weren't  merely a curiosity or a digital version
4:12
of the old mail order catalog, they were  the beginning of something that had the potential
4:16
to one day erase national boundaries  through trade and undermine government power.
4:22
In a prescient 1991 essay, he foresaw  how the internet would change the world by 1995,
4:28
2000, and beyond. The static  role of store and shopper,
4:32
seller and buyer, author and reader, systems  defined by their one-way information flows
4:38
will be replaced by new forms of media  enabling two-way information flows.
4:43
Before getting involved with computers,  Salin had run a private rocket company
4:47
and had coauthored a congressional study  critical of NASA's wasteful spending.
4:51
But in his view, there was continuity between  his interest in space travel and computing,
4:56
because in both industries, technology's  purpose was to drive down the transaction costs
5:00
that impede human activity,  making it feasible to explore new frontiers,
5:04
and interact in ways that would  otherwise be prohibitively expensive.
5:08
Now, thanks to breakthroughs in computing, the  ability to buy or obtain exactly the information you need
5:14
when you want it, in the form you want it, is about to explode at a speed unmatched since the invention of printing.
5:21
But Salin was foremost an entrepreneur, and in the mid-1980s,
5:25
he set out to launch one of those platforms for buying and selling information.
5:30
He called it the American  Information Exchange or AMIX.
5:34
This business that we're doing is to  make possible a new kind of thing,
5:38
which is being able to buy  and sell information online.
5:42
AMIX was a radical idea in the mid 1980s.
5:46
Users could buy or sell advice about the real estate market, writing software, or what companies to invest in.
5:52
Now, you can say to somebody, so  it's like eBay, or like Priceline, or like Amazon.
5:57
When we tried to explain this to people, they simply couldn't get it, they could not wrap their heads around this.
6:02
Some of them, I think, couldn't imagine the computational end of it. Milton Friedman didn't get it.
6:09
Though it was similar in ways to the online  marketplaces that would launch a decade later,
6:13
AMIX was more than just an idea before its time.
6:17
What set it apart was it the  grounding in political philosophy
6:20
and its lofty goal of elevating individual  decision-making over central planning.
6:25
It was an instantiation of Austrian  economics. Now put into code and put online.
6:33
Something like this could have profound  human consequences. And that was the vision.
6:37
"A fluid transaction-oriented market system,  with two-way feedback." Salin wrote,
6:43
"would result in crowding out monolithic,  mostly government bureaucracies."
6:47
We were laying the philosophical foundations  of what is e-commerce, that you can now have creative explosion.
6:55
It's going to change the world. Yes, that's right.
7:00
Intermediating among large populations  of human beings through electronic means
7:05
results in all kinds of fascinating  emergent social behavior.
7:09
AMIX's chief architect was the pioneering software  engineer, Chip Morningstar,
7:13
who had come from a stint at George Lucas's production studio, where he oversaw the creation of Habitat,
7:19
which was one of the first online virtual communities.
7:22
After joining AMIX, Morningstar coauthored an essay
7:25
which argued that in building a world in software, detailed central planning is impossible.
7:30
The world is just more complicated. People are more complicated, you cannot know what all their goals are.
7:35
What you can do is you can put them into an environment in which certain kinds of things are possible.
7:40
What you can't do is tell people what they want.
7:45
Phil Salin, Mark Miller, and Chip Morningstar's ideas about how a future internet could decentralize society
7:51
inspired Tim May to first articulate a radically different vision.
7:55
May, who would go on to become the most  influential figure in the cypherpunk movement,
7:59
was introduced to Salin by  Morningstar in December of 1987.
8:04
Chip said, "There's this guy out in  Santa Cruz that you ought to talk to."
8:07
As a scientist at Intel, May had solved an issue affecting the reliability of the company's memory chips,
8:13
called the Alpha Particle problem.
8:15
Rich on stock options, he'd been spending his days at the beach, reading science fiction novels,
8:20
thinking about how networked personal computers could turn some of their futuristic scenarios into reality.
8:27
So I met with Phil in Redwood City and he  described how AMIX would work. And I said,
8:32
"People aren't going to be selling meaningless  stuff like surfboard recommendations."
8:37
In May's view, AMIX could be useful  as a tool for undermining state power,
8:41
but only by shattering legal and social norms.
8:44
And I said, "It's going to be corporate  information. It's going to be bomber plans for the B-1 bomber.
8:49
Who wants to buy that? A competitor or a company.
8:52
Who wants to sell that? Someone who  has access to that information.
8:55
It's two different types of libertarians.  He didn't understand the extent to which
8:59
you could benefit the world by lowering  transaction costs for everybody.
9:14
Like Salin and The High-Tech Hayekians, May saw the personal computer as enabling technology  for sweeping societal changes.
9:21
But he had a different vision of a virtual marketplace for any and all goods and services,
9:26
which he dubbed Black Net, or a technological means of undermining all governments.
9:32
On AMIX user activity was out in the open, but Black Net would be impervious to government tracking and surveillance.
9:38
And perhaps it would be a network with no owners at all.
9:42
Many people's first response would be to say  that Black Net won't be allowed to happen.
9:46
Perhaps, but technology would  probably make it inevitable.
9:50
If you don't physically meet the person if you don't even know what continent they're on, you can't coerce them.
9:55
Tim May is a smart guy. He was great for  honing our ideas and technologies against.
10:02
But I think him as the shock jock for cypherpunks.
10:06
I want to live in the world that surrounds us rather than trying and construct one from scratch.
10:13
We saw this as emerging from inside the  world and carrying the world along with it.
10:20
In 1988, AMIX was acquired by the software giant, Autodesk.
10:25
A growing scene of young technologists came together around Salin and The High-Tech Hayekians,
10:30
all working towards a common vision of enhancing human freedom through networked personal computing.
10:36
It was this hot house of ideas  from which a worldview was brewing.
10:43
Salin died of cancer in 1991. The same year that  the World Wide Web became publicly available.
10:49
But his intellectual contributions and conflict with May had laid the groundwork for what would come next for the cypherpunks,
10:55
the long effort to build a self-sovereign and anonymous form of digital money,
11:00
and the embrace of a branch of mathematics called cryptography,
11:03
which they came to view as the key to  personal liberation on the internet.
